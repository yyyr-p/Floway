import type { ChatCompletionsInterceptor } from './types.ts';

// Chat Completions streaming only includes the final usage-only chunk when
// `stream_options.include_usage` is enabled. We force that on here because
// the gateway's source responders and usage tracking rely on those usage
// frames for both streaming passthrough and non-stream reassembly.
//
// The follow-on question is whether to surface the synthesized usage chunk to
// the client. The client's intent is whatever the caller put on
// `stream_options.include_usage` BEFORE this interceptor mutated it; the
// downstream SSE renderer reads that intent directly off the original payload
// the http entry parsed (see `chatCompletionsHttp`), so this interceptor only
// has to flip the upstream-facing flag and never needs to thread the original
// value through a Hono context slot.
