// Unified Chat Completions interceptor list. All entries are attached to
// every binding; each interceptor's body decides whether to act (flag-gated
// entries early-return on `ctx.candidate.binding.enabledFlags.has(flagId)`).
//
// Order follows source-then-target semantics collapsed into a single chain.
//
//   - withUsageStreamOptionsIncluded, withUsageNormalized: unconditional.
//     Both gate the gateway's usage-tracking pipeline. Turning either off
//     would silently break per-key telemetry, so neither is surfaced as a flag.
//   - withReasoningDisabledOnForcedToolChoice: gated by
//     `disable-reasoning-on-forced-tool-choice`. Emits the gateway's canonical
//     "no reasoning" sentinel only; vendor wire form is the vendor's job.
//   - withVendor*ChatCompletionsNormalize: gated by `vendor-<X>`. Registered
//     LAST so that on the outbound path each gets the final say on the wire
//     body and on the inbound path each gets the first say on the upstream
//     stream — the generic interceptors above only see OpenAI-canonical form.
//     Vendor flags are mutually exclusive in practice, but the interceptors
//     are independent and run in declared order if more than one is somehow
//     enabled.
