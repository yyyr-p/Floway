// Three-block `system` array we send to Anthropic on the re-mimicry path,
// plus the per-request fingerprint helper that feeds the billing block.
//
// `IDENTITY_BLOCK` is the byte-exact identity banner real CC sends as
// `system[1]`; `DEFAULT_TEMPLATE_BLOCK` carries the cache-anchored
// `system[2]` boilerplate and is intentionally a strict subset of the
// v2.1.181 wire shape — see the comment on that constant for why.
//
// `cch=00000` is a literal placeholder, not a client-computed hash.
// Anthropic's CC 2.x native binary emits `x-anthropic-billing-header:
// cc_version=…; cc_entrypoint=cli; cch=00000;` verbatim (confirmed via
// `strings` extraction of @anthropic-ai/claude-code-darwin-arm64@2.1.185's
// `package/claude`; the older 1.0.x JS bundle did not carry this header,
// which is why earlier audits searching cli.js missed it). sub2api's
// optional xxhash-based signer
// (https://github.com/Wei-Shaw/sub2api/commit/e51c9e50b5376cb486a0b7123e5f1ec026d5c526)
// defaults its `enable_cch_signing` toggle to OFF, and predecessor
// claude-relay-service has never shipped signing at all. Per-request hash
// mutation also poisons Anthropic's prompt cache (claude-code issues
// #40652, #50085, #68900). We ship the placeholder unconditionally.

// We deliberately drop the # System / # Doing tasks / # Executing actions
// with care / # Using your tools sections that real CC always emits.
// Those sections are CC-agent-action instructions ("prefer dedicated tools
// over Bash", "use TodoWrite to plan", "default to writing no comments")
// that would inappropriately steer the model when a non-CC downstream
// (Cursor, a custom agent, plain API consumer) is on the other end of the
// re-mimicry path. The structural presence of an identity block plus a
// safety/URL `IMPORTANT:` pair plus `# Tone and style` is sufficient for
// Anthropic's plan-billing detector — the detector keys on shape and
// identity, not on the trimmed sections.
//
// The opener line, both `IMPORTANT:` lines, and the `# Tone and style`
// bullets are byte-exact extracts from @anthropic-ai/claude-code@2.1.181's
// compiled prompt builder, captured 2026-06-19 by pointing the Bun-compiled
// binary at a local capture sink (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` → 401 echo) and
// reading back the wire-shape `system` array. When CC bumps and changes
// any of these lines, re-capture against the current binary.

IMPORTANT: Assist with authorized security testing, defensive security, CTF challenges, and educational contexts. Refuse requests for destructive techniques, DoS attacks, mass targeting, supply chain compromise, or detection evasion for malicious purposes. Dual-use security tools (C2 frameworks, credential testing, exploit development) require clear authorization context: pentesting engagements, CTF competitions, security research, or defensive use cases.
IMPORTANT: You must NEVER generate or guess URLs for the user unless you are confident that the URLs are for helping the user with programming. You may use URLs provided by the user in their messages or local files.

# Tone and style
 - Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid using emojis in all communication unless asked.
 - Your responses should be short and concise.
 - When referencing specific functions or pieces of code include the pattern file_path:line_number to allow the user to easily navigate to the source code location.
 - When referencing GitHub issues or pull requests, use the owner/repo#123 format (e.g. anthropics/claude-code#100) so they render as clickable links.
 - Do not use a colon before tool calls. Your tool calls may not be shown directly in the output, so text like "Let me read the file:" followed by a read tool call should just be "Let me read the file." with a period.`,
