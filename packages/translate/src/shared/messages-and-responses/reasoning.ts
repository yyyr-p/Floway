/**
 * Pack a Responses reasoning item's `id` and `encrypted_content` into an
 * Anthropic `thinking.signature` / `redacted_thinking.data` string using
 * `${encrypted_content}@${id}`.
 *
 * Why: an OpenAI Responses upstream signs `encrypted_content` against
 * `(account, item_id)` and rejects a next-turn submission whose `id` does not
 * match the id baked into the blob with `400 invalid_request_body: "Encrypted
 * content item_id did not match the target item id."`. Anthropic `thinking` /
 * `redacted_thinking` blocks have no id slot, so when we project a Responses
 * reasoning item into a Messages carrier for a downstream Messages CLIENT we
 * must smuggle the original Responses id alongside the blob, then recover it
 * when that client echoes the carrier back. We adopt the `${encrypted_content}@${id}`
 * layout used by the gateway implementations referenced below, so signatures
 * stay interchangeable if a user switches gateways mid-session.
 *
 * `encryptedContent` may be empty: a Responses-origin reasoning item can have
 * an id but no opaque content (we never auto-request
 * `reasoning.encrypted_content`), in which case `@rs_abc` is a valid,
 * round-trippable carrier.
 *
 * Scope: this packing is the bridge contract between the gateway and a
 * Messages CLIENT only. Toward a real Messages UPSTREAM we send the genuine
 * `encrypted_content` with no packing, and a genuine upstream signature is
 * never overwritten — see {@link unpackReasoningSignature}.
