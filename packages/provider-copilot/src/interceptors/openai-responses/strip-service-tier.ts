/**
 * Copilot has no request-side `service_tier`: `/responses` answers any value
 * of the field with HTTP 400
 * `{"code":"unsupported_value","param":"service_tier"}`, on a base id and a
 * `-fast` id alike. The tier reaches the upstream as the raw model id
 * `callOpenAIResponses` selected instead, so by the time this runs the value
 * has already been consumed and only the unusable field is left to drop.
 * Strip it only after planning has committed to the OpenAI Responses target
 * so source-side behavior and telemetry still see the caller's original
 * request. Generic in the run-result type so the same definition feeds both
 * the streaming `/responses` chain and the non-streaming compaction chain.
