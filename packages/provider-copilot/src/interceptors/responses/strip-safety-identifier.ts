/**
 * VSCode Copilot Chat does not insert `safety_identifier` on its `/responses`
 * calls. Our Anthropic-to-Responses translator never synthesizes it; native
 * Responses callers' values flow through untouched. This interceptor
 * enforces that asymmetry on the Copilot Responses target — strip only when
 * the request entered as a non-Responses shape (we synthesized it during
 * translation), and preserve whatever native Responses callers actually
 * sent.
 *
 * Chat Completions is not affected: the field flows through to Copilot's
 * Chat endpoint without rejection.
