 * Anthropic Messages tools may carry `strict: true` to compile

 * organization policy `constraints/vertexai.allowedPartnerModelFeatures`
 * denies `structured_outputs` by default — any tool with `strict: true`
 * trips a 400 `FAILED_PRECONDITION` from Vertex. We drop the field on
 * outbound; the model still respects `input_schema`, only the
 * grammar-constrained guarantee is gone.
