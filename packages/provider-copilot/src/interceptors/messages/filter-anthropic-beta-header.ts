/**
 * Copilot's Messages upstream is strict about the `anthropic-beta` header:
 * unknown beta flags cause hard 400s. Our policy:
 *
 *   - When the client supplies its own `anthropic-beta`: filter against the
 *     Copilot allow-list and forward what remains. The client opted into a
 *     specific set of betas; we do not silently add more.
 *   - When the client supplies no `anthropic-beta` AND requested extended
 *     thinking via `thinking.budget_tokens` AND did not request adaptive
 *     thinking: synthesize `interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14` so Copilot
 *     returns thinking blocks alongside the answer.
 *   - Otherwise: emit no `anthropic-beta` header.
 *
 * The split between "client supplied a header" and "we synthesize one" is
 * the load-bearing rule: respect the caller's intent when they expressed
 * one, and only paper over silent omissions with the VSCode default. This
 * also means a client that ships only `context-management-2025-06-27` will
 * not have interleaved auto-added even with non-adaptive budget thinking —
 * matching VSCode Copilot Chat.
 *
 * Generic in the run-result type because pre-Path A the equivalent filter
 * ran on every Copilot Messages HTTP exchange (chat AND count_tokens).
 * Keeping a single generic interceptor lets both the streaming Messages
 * boundary chain (`ExecuteResult<...>`) and the count_tokens chain
 * (`Response`) share one definition.
