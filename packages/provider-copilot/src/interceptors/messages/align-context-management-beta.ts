/**
 * Copilot's Anthropic-shaped upstream gates the body field `context_management`
 * on the presence of `anthropic-beta: context-management-2025-06-27`. When the
 * body carries the field but the header is missing, both Vertex- and Bedrock-
 * routed deployments reject the request with HTTP 400
 * `context_management: Extra inputs are not permitted` — a deterministic check,
 * not a backend split. Probed against api.enterprise.githubcopilot.com on
 * claude-opus-4.7 / sonnet-4.5 / haiku-4.5: same backend that returns 200 with
 * the header attached returns 400 seconds later when the header is dropped.
 *
 * Claude Code 2.1.x emits the field and the header in lockstep at its single
 * request-builder site, so a desync should not originate from the CLI under
 * normal env. We still see the desync in the wild at low frequency. The exact
 * source remains unconfirmed (a path we missed in the decompile, an env var
 * like CLAUDE_CODE_SIMULATE_PROXY_USAGE, or a wire-level header drop). Rather
 * than chase the upstream cause, repair the symmetry at the boundary: whenever
 * the outgoing payload carries `context_management`, ensure the outgoing
 * `anthropic-beta` carries the matching token. Probes confirm this is safe —
 * Copilot accepts the pair on every model and backend tested.
 *
 * Must run AFTER `withAnthropicBetaHeaderFiltered`, which is the canonical
 * writer of `ctx.headers['anthropic-beta']`. Reading the post-filter value is
 * the whole point.
