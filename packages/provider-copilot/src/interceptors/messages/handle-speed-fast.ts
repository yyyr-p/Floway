/**
 * Anthropic Fast Mode is a per-request opt-in carried by `speed: "fast"` on
 * the Messages request and echoed back as `usage.speed: "fast"`. Copilot
 * does not speak Fast Mode on the wire — the upstream resolves the tier via
 * the `-fast` raw model id picked by `model-selection.ts` and never echoes
 * `usage.speed`. This interceptor bridges the two contracts at the Copilot
 * boundary:
 *
 *   - Strip `speed: 'fast' | 'standard'` from the outbound payload. The
 *     value was already consumed by `callMessages` to pick the raw variant
 *     and pre-validate Fast Mode support, so passing it through to Copilot
 *     would just trigger an unknown-field 400 from a strict upstream.
 *   - Leave any other `speed` value untouched. Unknown values mean the
 *     caller is wrong; let Copilot surface the same invalid_request_error
 *     Anthropic itself would, rather than the gateway lying about which
 *     field the upstream rejected.
 *   - When the caller asked for Fast Mode, stamp `usage.speed = 'fast'`
 *     onto every `message_start` and `message_delta` frame on the way out
 *     so downstream sees the marker the billing path (`speed` → tier='fast'
 *     → `pricing.tiers.fast`) and Anthropic-compatible clients expect.
