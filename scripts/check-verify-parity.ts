// A verification that exists in only one of the two places is invisible. Named
// in `.github/workflows/verify.yaml` alone, it cannot be reproduced locally and
// nobody knows it is there; chained from `verify` alone, no pull request ever
// runs it. Both lists are therefore derived and compared here rather than kept
// in step by hand.
//
// Recognising a verification is the harder half. A command that reaches one
// without going through a root script -- `pnpm --filter <pkg> run <script>`, a
// bare `jiti scripts/....ts`, a `vitest` invocation -- would contribute nothing
// to a scan that only knows `pnpm run`, so the two derived sets would agree
// while the workflow ran something `verify` does not. An unrecognised command
// is therefore an error rather than an empty contribution, on both sides, which
// is also what makes the `Reach every verification through a root script`
// clause of the AGENTS.md rule enforceable rather than merely stated.
//
// The comparison is over script names, not over workflow entries: one matrix
// entry legitimately chains several scripts when they share expensive setup,
// and the workflow runs scripts outside the matrix -- `typegen` prepares the
// generated route types every type-aware check depends on.
//
// Comparing the two lists cannot see a verification absent from both, so the
// root manifest is swept as well. Which scripts are verifications is read off
// their names, the same convention their kind prefixes already encode; the
// sweep runs one way only, because `verify` also chains setup (`typegen`) and a
// build (`build:web`) that no naming rule marks as verifications.
//
// The workflow is read with a regex instead of a YAML parser, as
// pnpm-workspace.yaml is in check-agents-md.ts. Every `run:` value is recovered
// whole, so a form the parser was not built for (a block scalar, say) fails
// loudly instead of being silently skipped.
