/**
 * Pack a Responses reasoning item's `id` and `encrypted_content` into an
 * Anthropic `thinking.signature` / `redacted_thinking.data` string using
 * `${encrypted_content}@${id}`.
 *
 * Why: Responses reasoning `encrypted_content` is tied to its item id, and
 * upstreams that verify reasoning continuity reject a next-turn submission
 * whose `id` does not match the id baked into the blob with
 * `400 invalid_request_body: "Encrypted content item_id did not match the
 * target item id."`. Anthropic `thinking` / `redacted_thinking` blocks have no
 * id slot, so when we translate Responses output to Messages we must smuggle
 * the original Responses id alongside the blob, then recover it on the way
 * back up. The `${encrypted_content}@${id}` layout keeps this bridge compact
 * and remains compatible with existing gateway-issued transcripts.
 *
 * Scope: this helper is exclusive to the Messages<->Responses translation
 * pair. The packed signature is the bridge contract that downstream Messages
 * clients echo back on the next turn; it is not a general Anthropic signature
 * format, and other translation pairs should not interpret it.

/**
 * Inverse of {@link packReasoningSignature}.
 *
 * Returns `{ id, encryptedContent }` when the input matches the packed
 * `${encrypted_content}@${id}` shape, and `{ id: null, encryptedContent }`
 * otherwise — so signatures not issued by this gateway (e.g. native Anthropic
 * sessions resumed through this translation path, or stored sessions predating
 * the packing change) round-trip as-is and the caller falls back to a
 * synthesized id. Splits on the last `@`: base64 `encrypted_content` cannot
 * contain `@`, but using `lastIndexOf` matches caozhiyuan's parser and is
 * resilient if the upstream format ever widens.
