# Data Plane Translation

This document describes the current translation behavior between the four
client-facing data-plane APIs:

- Anthropic Messages: `POST /v1/messages`
- OpenAI Responses: `POST /v1/responses`
- OpenAI Chat Completions: `POST /v1/chat/completions`
- Google Gemini: `POST /v1beta/models/{model}:generateContent`,
  `POST /v1beta/models/{model}:streamGenerateContent`,
  `POST /v1beta/models/{model}:countTokens`, and `GET /v1beta/models`

Route planning uses provider-owned model capability data from
`supported_endpoints`. Request translation is direct and pairwise; there is no
canonical internal request IR. Provider-specific quirks live in provider-owned
model projection or provider interceptor collections rather than inside pairwise
translators.

## Routing

`/v1/messages` selects:

1. native `/v1/messages`
2. translated `/responses`
3. translated `/chat/completions`

`/v1/responses` selects:

1. native `/responses`
2. translated `/v1/messages`
3. translated `/chat/completions`

`/v1/chat/completions` selects:

1. native `/chat/completions`
2. translated `/v1/messages`
3. translated `/responses`

If no provider binding exposes a capability-backed Chat plan, the gateway
returns a source-shaped unsupported-model error. It does not invent legacy
model-name routing outside provider capability metadata. Copilot Claude models
still route through Messages because the Copilot provider does not expose Chat
support for them.

`/v1beta/models/{model}:generateContent` and
`/v1beta/models/{model}:streamGenerateContent` select:

1. translated `/chat/completions`
2. translated `/v1/messages`
3. translated `/responses`

If no provider binding exposes a capability-backed Gemini generation plan, the
gateway returns a Gemini-shaped unsupported-model error.

## Boundary Rules

- Pairwise translators preserve source semantics where the target API has a
  natural counterpart.
- Translators do not synthesize defaults merely to satisfy a target shape.
  Examples: no translated-only `temperature: 1`, `store: false`,
  `parallel_tool_calls: true`, or `reasoning.summary: "detailed"`.
- Fields with no natural target-side meaning are omitted instead of encoded
  into private bridges.
- Each protocol has one gateway-side interceptor list that runs once when the
  request enters the gateway in that protocol's shape. A Messages interceptor
  sees a Messages request and Messages result/events whether Messages is the
  source the client sent or the target the upstream serves; Responses, Chat
  Completions, and Gemini follow the same rule.
- Each provider runs its own boundary interceptor chain inside its `call*`
  method, after the gateway-side chain and immediately before the wire. The
  boundary chain owns provider-specific quirks: image compression, header
  shaping (`x-vision-request`, `x-initiator`, anthropic-beta filtering),
  field stripping (Copilot Responses `service_tier`, `image_generation`,
  `store: false` forcing), Copilot Messages `cache_control.scope` scrubbing,
  and similar.
- The provider parses raw upstream frames into typed protocol events before
  returning to the gateway, so every interceptor sees decoded events, not
  SSE bytes. The HTTP / WebSocket adapter at the gateway boundary owns the
  final wire shaping after the protocol events have been translated back to
  the source-protocol shape.

## Boundary Workarounds

### Messages — gateway interceptors

- rejects body-level `anthropic_beta` and `betas`; Anthropic beta flags are
  accepted only from the `anthropic-beta` HTTP header and passed to Messages
  providers as a separate parameter
- after planning, rewrites native Anthropic `web_search_*` server tools into a
  gateway-executed client-tool shim when the selected provider/target requires
  it, decodes shim-owned replay history back into upstream `search_result`
  blocks, and rewrites shim-owned search results/citations back to native
  Messages shape. The shim is enabled by default for Copilot Messages targets
  too, because Copilot search is executed by the gateway.
- strips reserved `x-anthropic-billing-header` prompt-attribution lines and
  `cch=<hash>` cache markers that some clients inline into the `system`
  prompt; these are opaque to every upstream and poison prompt-cache prefix
  hashes
- strips stray `[DONE]` sentinels from Anthropic-shaped streams

### Messages — Copilot provider boundary chain

- promotes upstream `thinking.display` during active thinking to avoid Copilot
  Messages idle gaps, then preserves downstream omitted-thinking semantics
- whitelists supported `anthropic-beta` values on the wire
- auto-adds `interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14` when budget thinking requires it
- strips unsupported per-tool `eager_input_streaming`
- strips unsupported `cache_control.scope` before calling Copilot native
  Messages. Custom Messages providers receive the caller's `cache_control`
  object unchanged.
- rewrites Copilot context-window errors into the compact Messages error shape

### Responses — gateway interceptors

- removes unsupported `image_generation` Responses tool entries and forced
  tool choices that targeted them before target request construction. Other
  hosted/deferred Responses tools, including `web_search`, `tool_search`, and
  `namespace`, remain visible to native Responses targets. Translated
  Messages/Chat targets currently narrow tool conversion to `function` and
  Freeform `custom` tools; the hosted/deferred translated semantics are
  tracked separately.
- preserves Freeform `custom` tools: native Responses targets receive them
  directly; translated targets wrap them as single-string function tools (see
  "Responses Custom Tool Wrapping").
- retries intermittent upstream `cyber_policy` failures before the failed
  attempt reaches the source-shaped response

### Responses — Copilot provider boundary chain

The same boundary runs for both `/v1/responses` (streaming) and
`/v1/responses/compact` (non-streaming).

- strips unsupported `service_tier`
- removes the `image_generation` tool entry (Copilot does not host it)
- forces `store: false` on the wire — the gateway always owns Responses
  persistence; the original `store` is captured by the entry adapter before
  the chain runs, so durable storage is unaffected
- compresses inline base64 image data URLs to WebP
- injects `x-vision-request` and `x-initiator` headers
- on `/v1/responses` only: retries expired connection-bound input IDs once
  with deterministic rewrites, and synchronizes mismatched stream output
  item IDs

### Responses — Codex provider boundary chain

Codex (ChatGPT subscription) only serves Responses; Messages, Chat
Completions, and Gemini reach Codex through translation. The same boundary
runs for both `/v1/responses` and the synthesized `/v1/responses/compact`
path (Codex has no native compact endpoint; the provider drives `compaction_trigger`
inline and rebuilds the envelope client-side).

- hoists `role: "system"` items out of `input` into top-level `instructions`
  (the upstream rejects system messages inside `input`)
- injects a default `instructions` string when none is supplied (the upstream
  rejects empty / missing `instructions`)
- strips fields the upstream rejects with `Unsupported parameter`:
  `max_output_tokens`, `temperature`, `top_p`, `frequency_penalty`,
  `presence_penalty`, `user`, `metadata`, `prompt_cache_retention`,
  `safety_identifier`, `stream_options`
- injects a stable `session-id` header derived from
  `(instructions + first user-message text)` so the upstream prompt cache
  hits across turns of the same conversation (~88% input-token cache hit
  measured against gpt-5.4)

### Chat Completions — gateway interceptors

- forces upstream streaming usage when needed for gateway usage telemetry.
  The Chat source still only exposes final usage-only SSE chunks to clients
  when the caller requested `stream_options.include_usage: true`. Hidden
  upstream usage is preserved separately for gateway telemetry.

### Gemini — gateway interceptors

- removes unsupported `fileData`, `executableCode`, and `codeExecutionResult`
  part fields before target request construction
- removes unsupported Gemini tool capabilities such as `googleSearch`,
  `codeExecution`, URL context, file search, MCP servers, and maps, keeping
  only function declarations
- drops `safetySettings`, which has no upstream target control
- hides `thought: true` summary parts by default; they are only returned
  when `generationConfig.thinkingConfig.includeThoughts === true`. Opaque
  `thoughtSignature` values are preserved when the target is Messages or
  Chat (which carry them through `signature` / `reasoning_opaque`), but are
  not translated into Responses reasoning state.
- shapes errors as Google RPC Status payloads while preserving internal
  debug fields for gateway failures

## Gemini Source

Request mapping shared by the Gemini source translation pairs:

- URL model IDs from `/v1beta/models/{model}:...` become the target request
  model after normal model resolution.
- `contents[].role: "user"` becomes user input; `contents[].role: "model"`
  becomes assistant/model output history.
- text parts map to target text blocks/messages.
- supported `inlineData` images (`image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/gif`, and
  `image/webp`) map to target image inputs where the target supports them.
- `systemInstruction.parts[].text` becomes the target system/instructions field,
  joined with blank lines.
- `functionCall` maps to target tool/function calls. Missing Gemini function
  call IDs are replaced with deterministic `gemini_call_<turn>_<part>` IDs so
  later `functionResponse` parts can be paired.
- `functionResponse` maps to target tool/function results. When the response
  lacks an ID, the translator pairs it with the earliest unmatched call of the
  same function name, then falls back to a deterministic ID.
- Gemini `thought: true` text maps to target readable reasoning/thinking.
- Gemini `thoughtSignature` maps to Messages `signature` / `redacted_thinking`
  or Chat `reasoning_opaque` when those targets are selected. Responses targets
  ignore Gemini opaque signatures and keep only readable thought text.
- `thinkingBudget` and `thinkingLevel` map to the target's closest reasoning or
  thinking controls. Budget `0` disables thinking via Messages
  `thinking.disabled`, Responses `reasoning.effort: "none"`, or Chat
  `reasoning_effort: "none"`; positive budgets choose low/medium/high effort
  where the target only supports effort levels.
- `maxOutputTokens`, `temperature`, `topP`, `topK`, `stopSequences`,
  `presencePenalty`, `frequencyPenalty`, `seed`, `responseMimeType`, and
  `responseSchema` are passed through when the selected target has a natural
  field.
- Gemini function declarations become target function/tool definitions;
  `functionCallingConfig` maps to the closest target tool-choice control.

Response mapping shared by the Gemini source translation pairs:

- Target text output becomes Gemini model content text parts.
- Target reasoning summaries or thinking deltas become Gemini thought-summary
  parts internally, then the Gemini gateway interceptors remove them unless
  the client explicitly requested `includeThoughts: true`.
- Target opaque reasoning signatures from Messages or Chat become Gemini
  `thoughtSignature` attached to the next visible text or function-call action
  part. Responses targets do not emit opaque Gemini signatures; only readable
  reasoning summaries become thought-summary parts.
- Target tool/function calls become Gemini `functionCall` parts.
- Target usage maps to Gemini `usageMetadata`; reasoning/thinking tokens map to
  `thoughtsTokenCount` when available.
- Gemini streaming emits data-only SSE chunks containing full
  `GenerateContentResponse` objects and does not emit a `[DONE]` sentinel.
- Gemini non-streaming responses are assembled from source-shaped Gemini event
  streams.

Gemini models and token counting:

- `GET /v1beta/models` and `GET /v1beta/models/{model}` translate the merged
  provider model list to Gemini model objects with `generateContent`,
  `streamGenerateContent`, and `countTokens` generation methods.
- `POST /v1beta/models/{model}:countTokens` translates the Gemini request shape
  through the Messages count-tokens path.

Known losses:

- `fileData`, executable-code parts, code-execution results, cached content,
  Gemini Files API URIs, native code execution, grounding/citation metadata, URL
  context, file search, maps, computer use, and MCP server tools have no current
  upstream target equivalent and are omitted.
- `googleSearch` is currently dropped by the Gemini gateway interceptors;
  future work should route it through the existing web-search shim.
- `safetySettings` are omitted because the Copilot targets do not expose
  equivalent safety controls.
- `candidateCount > 1` is not supported by the Copilot targets; the gateway
  returns one candidate.
- Gemini response safety ratings, grounding metadata, and citation metadata are
  not synthesized from ordinary target output.

## Messages To Responses

Request mapping:

- `system` becomes Responses `instructions`; multi-block system text is joined
  with blank lines.
- user text and images become Responses `message` input content.
- user `tool_result` blocks become `function_call_output` items, preserving
  source order relative to user text by splitting input items when necessary.
- assistant text becomes `message` items with `output_text` content.
- assistant `tool_use` blocks become `function_call` items.
- assistant `thinking` and `redacted_thinking` blocks become `reasoning` input
  items. The carrier (`thinking.signature` or `redacted_thinking.data`) is
  unpacked from the `${encrypted_content}@${id}` shape this gateway emits: the
  Responses reasoning id and any opaque `encrypted_content` are recovered. A
  native signature carrying no `@` is preserved verbatim as `encrypted_content`
  with a synthesized `rs_${index}` id; it is never overwritten.
- `max_tokens`, `temperature`, `top_p`, `metadata`, and `stream` pass through
  when present.
- `output_config.effort` maps directly to `reasoning.effort`; disabled thinking
  maps to `reasoning.effort: "none"`; enabled thinking without explicit effort
  is omitted.
- Messages tools become Responses function tools. Omitted Messages `strict`
  becomes Responses `strict: false`, preserving non-strict default behavior.
- `tool_choice` maps `auto` -> `auto`, `any` -> `required`, named tool -> named
  function, and `none` -> `none`.

Response mapping:

- Responses `reasoning` output becomes a Messages carrier with the reasoning id
  and any `encrypted_content` packed as `${encrypted_content}@${id}`: readable
  summary text yields a `thinking` block (packed value in `signature`); no
  readable text yields a `redacted_thinking` block (packed value in `data`), so
  the id always round-trips to a downstream Messages client.
- assistant text becomes `message` output items and contributes to
  `output_text`.
- assistant `tool_use` becomes `function_call` output items.
- `max_tokens` stop maps to `status: "incomplete"`; other normal stops map to
  `status: "completed"`.
- cache read tokens map to Responses `input_tokens_details.cached_tokens`.
- Output item order follows the original assistant block order.

Known losses:

- `stop_sequences`, `top_k`, and Messages `service_tier` have no Responses
  request counterpart and are omitted.
- Anthropic `thinking: { type: "enabled" }` without explicit effort has no
  Responses request-side equivalent and is not emulated.

## Responses To Messages

Request mapping:

- `instructions` and input `system` / `developer` messages become top-level
  Messages `system`, joined with blank lines.
- string input becomes one user message.
- user `input_text` becomes Messages text; `input_image` URLs are resolved via
  the shared remote-image loader and converted to base64 image blocks when
  supported.
- assistant `output_text` becomes assistant text blocks.
- `function_call` becomes assistant `tool_use`.
- `function_call_output` becomes user `tool_result`; incomplete status marks the
  tool result as an error.
- `reasoning` becomes a Messages thinking carrier bound for the real Messages
  upstream, which owns and validates the signature: the genuine
  `encrypted_content` is sent verbatim with no gateway envelope — as
  `thinking.signature` when there is readable summary text, else as
  `redacted_thinking.data`. A reasoning with neither readable text nor opaque
  content has nothing the upstream can verify and is dropped; one with text but
  no opaque content becomes a `thinking` block with no signature.
- `max_output_tokens`, `temperature`, `top_p`, and `stream` pass through when
  present.
- `reasoning.effort: "none"` maps to disabled thinking; any other explicit
  effort maps to `output_config.effort`.
- Responses function tools become Messages tools, preserving explicit `strict`.
  Freeform `custom` tools are wrapped as single-string function tools; see
  "Responses Custom Tool Wrapping".
- Responses `tool_choice` maps to the corresponding Messages tool choice when
  representable. `{type:'custom', name}` collapses onto the wrapped function
  tool name.

Response mapping:

- Responses output items are converted in output order.
- `reasoning` maps to a Messages thinking carrier; the upstream's genuine
  `signature` (or `redacted_thinking` `data`) is carried verbatim as the
  reasoning item's `encrypted_content`, with a synthesized `rs_${index}` id.
- `message` content maps to text. `refusal` content is kept visible as text
  because Messages has no local refusal block.
- `function_call` maps to `tool_use`.
- `completed` maps to `end_turn` or `tool_use`; max-output incomplete maps to
  `max_tokens`.
- cached input tokens are subtracted from Anthropic `input_tokens` and exposed
  as `cache_read_input_tokens`.

Known losses:

- generic Responses `metadata` is omitted; it is not coerced into
  `metadata.user_id`.
- Pure Responses-to-Messages translation does not own response-level state.
  The API data plane expands `previous_response_id` and stored item ids before
  invoking this translator.
- Freeform `custom` tool `format.definition` is preserved as a
  `Lark grammar: ${definition}` description on the wrapped `input` parameter;
  other `format` fields are not preserved.
- Remote image fetch failures and unsupported image media types drop that image
  rather than failing the request.

## Messages To Chat Completions

Request mapping:

- top-level Messages `system` becomes a leading Chat `system` message.
- user text and images become Chat user content.
- user `tool_result` blocks become Chat `tool` messages. Mixed user text and
  tool results are split into multiple Chat messages to preserve source order.
- assistant text becomes Chat assistant `content`.
- assistant `tool_use` blocks become OpenAI `tool_calls`.
- assistant `thinking` / `redacted_thinking` projects only the first
  source-order scalar reasoning group into Chat `reasoning_text` /
  `reasoning_opaque`.
- `max_tokens`, `stop_sequences` -> `stop`, `stream`, `temperature`, and `top_p`
  pass through when present.
- non-empty `output_config.effort` maps directly to `reasoning_effort`;
  disabled thinking maps to `reasoning_effort: "none"`; enabled thinking
  without explicit effort is omitted.
- streaming translated requests force upstream `stream_options.include_usage` so
  gateway usage telemetry can see usage.
- Messages tools become OpenAI function tools; explicit `strict` is preserved
  and omitted `strict` remains omitted.
- Messages `tool_choice` maps to OpenAI `tool_choice` where representable.

Response mapping:

- assistant text blocks concatenate into Chat assistant `content`.
- `tool_use` blocks become `tool_calls`.
- only the first source-order reasoning group is projected into scalar Chat
  reasoning fields.
- usage maps to Chat prompt/completion tokens; cache read tokens become
  `prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`.
- `tool_use` stop maps to `tool_calls`; `max_tokens` maps to `length`; other
  normal stops map to `stop`.

Known losses:

- multiple Messages thinking blocks cannot be represented losslessly in legacy
  Chat scalar fields. Later groups are omitted rather than aggregated or
  mismatched.
- assistant-side images have no Chat counterpart and are omitted.
- `top_k`, `service_tier`, and other Messages-only fields are omitted.

## Chat Completions To Messages

Request mapping:

- Chat `system` and `developer` messages become top-level Messages `system`,
  joined with blank lines.
- Chat user text and supported images become Messages user blocks. Remote images
  are resolved through the shared loader.
- Chat assistant `content` becomes assistant text.
- Chat assistant scalar `reasoning_text` / `reasoning_opaque` becomes one
  `thinking` block or one `redacted_thinking` block.
- Chat assistant `tool_calls` become Messages `tool_use` blocks.
- Chat `tool` messages become Messages `tool_result` blocks.
- `max_tokens`, `temperature`, `top_p`, `stop`, `stream`, tools, and tool choice
  map where representable.
- OpenAI function tools preserve explicit `strict`; omitted `strict` stays
  omitted.

Response mapping:

- multiple Chat choices are merged into one Messages response.
- scalar reasoning blocks are emitted before text, and text before tool use.
- scalar opaque-only reasoning becomes `redacted_thinking` rather than fake
  readable thinking.
- Chat usage maps to Messages usage; cached prompt tokens become
  `cache_read_input_tokens`.

Known losses:

- Chat `message.name`, legacy `user`, and generic Chat metadata are omitted on
  translated Messages paths.
- Chat `reasoning_items[]` is not a Messages bridge; readable summaries in that
  shape are only used for the Chat <-> Responses path.
- Chat image `detail` is not represented in Messages.
- Multiple choices lose choice index and separation.

## Chat Completions To Responses

Request mapping:

- only the initial contiguous Chat `system` prefix becomes Responses
  `instructions`.
- later `system` messages and all `developer` messages remain ordered Responses
  input messages.
- user content becomes Responses user input content.
- assistant text becomes Responses assistant `output_text` content.
- assistant `tool_calls` become `function_call` input items.
- Chat `tool` messages become `function_call_output` input items.
- Chat `reasoning_items[]` entries with readable summaries are preferred over
  scalar reasoning. If absent, scalar `reasoning_text` becomes one Responses
  `reasoning` item; scalar `reasoning_opaque` is ignored.
- `temperature`, `top_p`, `max_tokens` -> `max_output_tokens`, `metadata`,
  `stream`, `store`, `parallel_tool_calls`, `prompt_cache_key`,
  `safety_identifier`, and `service_tier` pass through when present.
- `reasoning_effort` maps directly to `reasoning.effort` only when explicit.
- `response_format` maps directly to Responses `text.format`, including explicit
  `null`.
- OpenAI function tools become Responses tools. Explicit `strict` is preserved;
  omitted Chat `strict` becomes Responses `strict: false`.

Response mapping:

- Chat `reasoning_items[]` entries with readable summaries are preferred over
  scalar reasoning and become Responses reasoning output items.
- scalar `reasoning_text` becomes one Responses reasoning output item when no
  readable carrier is present; scalar `reasoning_opaque` is ignored.
- Chat content becomes one Responses `message` output item.
- Chat tool calls become Responses `function_call` output items.
- terminal Responses output is ordered by `output_index`, not completion time.
- `length` maps to `status: "incomplete"`; other finish reasons map to
  `completed`.

Known losses:

- Chat `stop` has no Responses request counterpart and is omitted.
- legacy Chat `user` is omitted on translated Chat/Responses paths.

## Responses To Chat Completions

Request mapping:

- `instructions` becomes a leading Chat `system` message.
- string input becomes a user message.
- input `message` items become Chat messages with matching roles.
- input `reasoning` items with readable summaries attach to the surrounding
  assistant message as `reasoning_items[]`; the first scalar-eligible group also
  projects to `reasoning_text`.
- `function_call` items become assistant `tool_calls`.
- `function_call_output` items become Chat `tool` messages.
- `max_output_tokens`, `stream`, `temperature`, `top_p`, `metadata`, `store`,
  `parallel_tool_calls`, `prompt_cache_key`, `safety_identifier`,
  `service_tier`, and explicit `reasoning.effort` pass through when present.
- Responses `text.format` maps directly to Chat `response_format`; `text: {}`
  omits `response_format`, while `text: null` stays explicit `null`.
- Responses function tools become Chat function tools, preserving `strict`.
  Freeform `custom` tools are wrapped as single-string function tools; see
  "Responses Custom Tool Wrapping".

Response mapping:

- Responses `message` output text becomes Chat assistant `content`; refusal text
  is kept visible as text.
- Responses `function_call` output becomes Chat `tool_calls`.
- every Responses reasoning output item with readable summary text is preserved
  in Chat `reasoning_items[]`.
- legacy scalar `reasoning_text` projects only the first scalar-eligible
  reasoning group; no `reasoning_opaque` value is synthesized from Responses
  reasoning.
- max-output incomplete maps to Chat `finish_reason: "length"`; completed with
  tool calls maps to `tool_calls`; other completed responses map to `stop`.

Known losses:

- Responses request-level `reasoning` has no Chat request counterpart except
  explicit effort.
- Pure Responses-to-Chat translation does not own response-level state. The API
  data plane expands `previous_response_id` and stored item ids before invoking
  this translator, with readable reasoning ids then carried through
  `reasoning_items[]`.
- Freeform `custom` tool `format.definition` is preserved as a
  `Lark grammar: ${definition}` description on the wrapped `input` parameter;
  other `format` fields are not preserved.
- opaque Responses reasoning state is not requested, translated, or preserved on
  Chat fallback paths.

## Responses Custom Tool Wrapping

Responses Freeform `custom` tools have no Anthropic or Chat Completions
counterpart. The Responses-to-Messages and Responses-to-Chat-Completions
translators wrap each `custom` tool as a single-string function tool with the
schema:

```json
{ "type": "object", "additionalProperties": false,
  "required": ["input"], "properties": { "input": { "type": "string" } } }
```

When the source `custom` tool provides `format.definition` (the Lark grammar
source), the translator copies it into the `input` parameter's `description`
prefixed with `Lark grammar: ` so target models still see what shape the
freeform value should follow. Other `format` fields (`type`, `syntax`, ...)
are not preserved. Tool names get tracked per trip; the events translator
recognizes wrapped function calls coming back from the target by name,
unwraps the `input` field from the JSON arguments blob, and projects the
result as `custom_tool_call` output items plus
`response.custom_tool_call_input.delta` / `.done` events to the Responses
caller. Wrapped tool-call argument deltas are buffered and emitted as a single
input delta at stop time because freeform values cannot be safely split out of
partial JSON. Tool choice referencing a `custom` tool maps to the
function-shape choice for the wrapped target. Historical `custom_tool_call` /
`custom_tool_call_output` input items are projected into the wrapped
function-tool history shape so multi-turn conversations remain coherent.

Native Responses targets continue to receive `custom` tools, tool choices, and
historical custom tool call items unchanged.

## Streaming Semantics

- Anthropic-shaped streams never expose `[DONE]` to Messages clients.
- Chat-shaped streams use OpenAI `data:` chunks and may expose a final
  usage-only chunk only when the caller requested it.
- Responses-shaped streams use named Responses SSE events with monotonically
  increasing `sequence_number`.
- Chat -> Responses stream translation buffers scalar reasoning until it knows
  whether `reasoning_items[]` will be used, avoiding orphan or duplicated
  Responses reasoning items.
- Responses -> Chat and Responses -> Messages stream translation preserve output
  order when later visible output arrives before earlier reasoning/tool output
  is complete.
- Chat -> Messages stream translation keeps opaque-only reasoning in source
  order and flushes pending final usage before `message_stop`.
- Tool/function argument streams guard against infinite whitespace in generated
  arguments and emit an error rather than continuing a degenerate stream.

## Reasoning Policy

- Translated Responses paths keep readable reasoning summaries and omit opaque
  encrypted reasoning state.
- Chat `reasoning_items[]` carries readable Responses reasoning summaries when
  Chat is the fallback protocol.
- legacy Chat scalar reasoning fields represent exactly one readable scalar
  group on Chat <-> Responses paths: `reasoning_text` only.
- Messages <-> Chat may still carry Anthropic opaque thinking through Chat
  `reasoning_opaque`, because that is a Messages/Chat compatibility surface and
  not a Responses encrypted-reasoning bridge.

## Standard OpenAI Field Policy

For translated Chat <-> Responses paths, same-purpose OpenAI fields pass through
directly where both APIs define them:

- `metadata`
- `store`
- `parallel_tool_calls`
- `response_format` / `text.format`
- `prompt_cache_key`
- `safety_identifier`
- explicit `reasoning_effort` / `reasoning.effort`

These fields are not bridged through Anthropic Messages-only paths unless the
Messages API has an explicit equivalent.
