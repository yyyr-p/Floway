// Part of the app's CSS is authored in TypeScript, because its rules spend
// values the running app spends too: the WinUI layer under src/winui
// interpolates the token names and motion durations that the same modules hand
// to Fluent, and the critical block interpolates the type stack the Fluent
// theme object is built from. Rendered straight into a `<style>` element that
// text never meets Vite's CSS pipeline -- it ships unminified, unhashed, and
// the larger of the two is re-sent in full with every HTML response.
//
// Each such module is therefore also reachable as a virtual `.css` module. The
// TypeScript is evaluated here and its string handed to Vite, which from that
// point treats it as an ordinary stylesheet: `?url` emits a hashed, minified,
// cacheable asset and yields its URL, `?inline` yields the minified text for a
// sheet that has to stay in the document.
//
// Vite performs the evaluation itself. `runnerImport` stands up a throwaway
// server environment, runs the module through the same resolver and transform
// pipeline the app is built with, and tears the environment down again, so
// there is no second toolchain to keep in agreement with this config and no
// registry that outlives the call:
// https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/v8.1.5/packages/vite/src/node/ssr/runnerImport.ts#L14-L48
// It is also what reports the files the module read. A virtual sheet has no
// imports of its own as far as the graph is concerned, so that list is the
// only thing connecting an edit deep in the graph to the id that has to be
// rebuilt. Nothing in these graphs may reach a module that expects a browser,
// since this runs in Node.
