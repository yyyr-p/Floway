 *
 * Anything that varies per provider-binding attempt belongs on `Invocation`,
 * not here. `statefulResponsesContext` is the one exception: the serve loop
 * reassigns it per attempt so cross-layer readers outside `Invocation`
 * plumbing (output persistence, source-interceptor `transformItems`) reach it
 * via the only handle they have. Read it through
 * `request.statefulResponsesContext` at access time; never capture the
 * inner object in a closure or background task — that snapshot belongs to
 * one attempt only.
 *
 * Telemetry recording is done via global helpers that accept `apiKeyId` (and
 * `scheduleBackground` for performance) explicitly so call sites stay visible
 * about the no-op when the request has no API key (ADMIN_KEY playground path).

 *   the planner picked for this binding.
 * - model: the resolved public model id.
 * - upstream / upstreamModel / provider: the planner's binding choice.
 * - enabledFlags: the effective flag set for this binding.
 * - targetInterceptors: the provider-registered target interceptor table.
 * - payload: the source-shape request body, mutable so source interceptors
 *   can clean it.
 * - headers: mutable HTTP-header bag the source serve seeds empty and target
 *   interceptors populate. The provider's upstream call passes it through to
 *   the wire fetch unchanged, so workarounds that only need to set or drop a
 *   header (vision, initiator, anthropic-beta, ...) stay at the owning
 *   interceptor boundary instead of widening the provider call signature.
 *
 * Named `Invocation` (not `Exchange`) because "exchange" implies a
 * request/response pair; this object carries only the request side plus the
 * planner's binding decisions. The response flows through `ExecuteResult`,
 * not back through `Invocation`.
 *
 * apiKeyId, downstreamAbortSignal, telemetry recorders are NOT on
 * `Invocation` — they belong on `RequestContext` because they don't change
 * when the planner tries another binding.
